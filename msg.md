_[Yesterday, I mentioned I was working on something](%+K/u5SyRWkw5/GiTHCK73drZm2FL9RCTUTr3qADPoQk=.sha256), well, this is it. I'm launching **Project Moon Hermit** which is something that I [mentioned a couple](%ghYxzIe1atwTudROwjibfMnlDLWQuUI+KyAfNXbl/AQ=.sha256) [times in the past](%nbCypNv4VBvSyFCFjLCSez2H0xHf3YLuT1/CWhhX2b4=.sha256) but never really tried out. Well, yesterday, I decided to test the idea out instead of doing actual work and much to my surprise, it started working._
